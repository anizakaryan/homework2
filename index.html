	<li>Retrieve online information via hypertext links, at the click of a button.</li>
	<li>Design forms for conducting transactions with remote services, for use in searching for information, making reservations, ordering products, etc.</li>
	<li>Include spread-sheets, video clips, sound clips, and other applications directly in their documents.</li>
